        <TextBlock HorizontalAlignment="Left" Text="Welcome young Wall. You are new here, aren't you? Anyways, welcome to Wolf Street. Your objective is pretty simple. I will give you a small loan of a mill... No wait. No that much. A small loan of $1000 to get you started in your career as a day trader. You will buy out shares when they are low, and you will sell them when they are high. Seems pretty simple, right? WRONG!! A million things could go wrong! But you will get the hang of it eventually. I will be by in a few days, to collect my cash. I won't charge an interest, because I like you... Unless... You don't have my money! Then I will. But we'll cross that bridge when we get there. For now, go out and make some money! Your living standard depends on it. I will give you 30 days. To make as much money as you possibly can. Oh, by the way, I've set you up in a temporary apartment. You will have to pay per day, and the rent is $500 a night. You should also expect to spend around $100 a day for food. Anywhoozle, I will get out of your hair! Get to earning!! Good luck!"
